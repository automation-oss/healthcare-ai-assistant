### Revenue Cycle Management Fundamentals

Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) spans patient registration, eligibility checks, charge capture, medical coding, claim submission, payment posting, and denial follow-up. Strong RCM programs pair accurate front-end data collection with back-end denial analytics to protect margins.

### Coding Quality

Accurate documentation and consistent ICD-10/CPT assignment avoid payer rejections. Coding audits should measure denial rates by provider and code, while education tracks documentation gaps for specialties such as cardiology and orthopedics.

### Denial Management

High-performing teams categorize denials by root cause, automate appeal letter creation, and monitor overturn rates. BillingParadise benchmarks show that closing denial feedback loops can recover 3–5% of net revenue that would otherwise be written off.
